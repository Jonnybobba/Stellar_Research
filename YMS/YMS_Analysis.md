# Stellar Research 
### Group Project 1

Our group found a dataset from NASA with information on exoplanets and stellar systems and used it to extract data to answer life's biggest questions...

The main question I focused on was what made it possible for life on Earth? Were there any other planets that fit that description? The Goldilocks Zone is filled with exoplanets that hold the same characterisitics of Earth and this dataset has been filtered down to one planet that has the most similiarity.

After cleaning the dataset, the first thing addressed was the correlation between the number of planets formed because of high or low amounts of stellar metallicity. Higher metallicity causes rocky gas giants like Neptune or Jupiter to form, while low metallicity has lower probabilities of forming dangerous planetary systems. A green dot is used for Earth for comparison at a metallicity value of 0.

The next question was, how big does a planet need to be in order to be habitable? The dataset was filtered even further with planets that have the similar radius size as Earth, with about 38 planets being possibly habitable.

One of the biggest discrepancies of a planet would be its equilibrium temperature. High stellar metallicity emits radiation that affects the planet equilibrium temperature, causing a greenhouse effect. Finding planets that fit a certain range of temperature to allow water to stay in liquid form was done and plotted.

Although, having liquid water is important, the planet temperatures needed to be filtered even more to find planets that had an even more habitable temperatures, 5°C to 40°C, and found one single planet that fit this and all other requirements.\
