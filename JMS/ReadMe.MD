##Stellar Qualities and their effect on the Number of Planets in a given Planetary System
The main point of my section of the project was to take the three most defining stellar qualities in our dataset (Temperature, Mass and Density) and determine if there was a significant 
relationship between said qualities and the number of planets the system could/did support. 
The most interesting quality was temperature measured in Kelvins. This showed that only the 70% and higher of planet temperatures supported more than 7 planets with 8 being the maximum
number of planets in our dataset (coincidentally the same number as our solar system).
The sun (our star) has a mass of 1 being that it is the standard of measurement used by astrophysicist and other related scientists.
The sun has a temperature of 5780 Kelvins which places it just slightly below the 70% mark. The Density is 1.4 placing it in the middle of the pack so to speak.
When looking at the other two qualities, the sun and it's supported system of 8 planets (one of which this analysis is being written on) falls in the range of other 8 planet systems.
If you look at the graphs for density and mass you will see that the sun fits just below both ranges that have 8 planets. My original hypothesis was that there would be a positive correlation
between temp/density/mass, so as these increase so too would the number of planets. What we found however is that there is more of a "sweet spot" in relation to these factors. 
A place where more planets can exist depending on the star and the sun is just a really habitable star.
