Many factors go into a planet and star movements. This portion of the analysis set out to see the relationship between the factors that cause movements. The two factors that had the highest correlation was Planet Orbital Semi Major Axis(which is the distance a planet is from its sun), and the orbital period of the planet. The only other significant correlation was stellar radius/planet radius and, planet mass and planet radius.
