## Importing data

* The data needed for this analysis was from a database constructed by NASA.
* The first step is to restrict the imported data frame down to the data we need to counstruct our conclusions (26000 --> 227 & 89).

## Determining Terestrial Planets

* A conditional statement needs to be implimented so we can color coordinate the terestrial and gaseous planets.
* After the conditional statement splits the planets into the two groups one can run a scatter plot analyzing the planets density and radius.
* Then place relative points for known planets like Earth and Jupiter.

#### Terestrial Conclusion

* The data presented showed that the small dense planets tend to sit in the classification for terestrial planets.
* Where as less dense planet will usually be gaseous.
* There were however some points that are cause for questioning because they are more dense that earth, but also larger than jupiter.
