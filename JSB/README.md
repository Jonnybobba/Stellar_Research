## Importing data

* The data needed for this analysis was from a database constructed by NASA.
* The first step is to restrict the imported data frame down to the data we need to counstruct our conclusions (26000 --> 227 & 89).

## Determining Terestrial Planets

* A conditional statement needs to be implimented so we can color coordinate the terestrial and gaseous planets.
* After the conditional statement splits the planets into the two groups one can run a scatter plot analyzing the planets density and radius.
* Then place relative points for known planets like Earth and Jupiter.

#### Terestrial Conclusion

* The data presented showed that the small dense planets tend to sit in the classification for terestrial planets.
* Where as less dense planet will usually be gaseous.
* There were however some points that are cause for questioning because they are more dense that earth, but also larger than jupiter.


## Star Analysis

* After composing a linear regression function, we looked for correlations between different star qualities.

#### Stellar Conclusion

* First off, I looked at how star age effects different star qualities (Mass & Luminocity). The Inverse Correlation between these two qualities and star age showed that as stars aged they would lose mass and be less luminous.

* Then I looked at how luminocity compared to energy release (Temperature & Velocity). Since energy cannot be created or destroyed, the light from the stars must come from some energy source, and from our data one cans see that temperature and velocity both have a positive correlation.
